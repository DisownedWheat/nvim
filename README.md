# The One True NeoVim Config

This config is a heavily edited version of AstroNVim. It's full of mistakes, commented sections, and random flights of fancy. I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone. If anyone would like to offer improvements (such as deleting this repo and starting again) I would be grateful.
